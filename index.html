      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
        <p>This document provides <a href="#best-practices">best practices</a> for specification authors who need to identify <a>natural language</a> values in their document formats or protocols via the use of <a>language tags</a> [[BCP47]], including common operations such as <a>language negotiation</a>. It also provides recommendations for how to specify <a>locale-aware</a> or <a>internationalized</a> behavior and defines core terminology that specifications might need to refer to these behaviors or capabilities.</p>

        <p>Tags for identifying the <a>natural language</a> of content or the <a>international preferences</a> of users are one of the fundamental building blocks of the Web. The <a>language tags</a> found in Web and Internet formats and protocols are defined by [[BCP47]]. Consistent use of language tags provides applications the ability to perform language-specific formatting or processing. For example, a user-agent might use the language to select an appropriate font for displaying text or a Web page designer might style text differently in one language than in another.</p>
        
        <p>Many of the core standards for the Web include support for <a>language tags</a>; these include the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute in [[XML10]], the <code>lang</code> and <code>hreflang</code> atttributes in [[HTML]], the <code>language</code> property in [[XSL10]], and the <code>:lang</code> pseudo-class in CSS [[CSS3-SELECTORS]]. </p>
        
        <p><a>Language tags</a> can also be used to identify <a>international preferences</a> associated with a given piece of content or user because these preferences are linked to the natural language, regional association, or culture of the end user. Such preferences are applied to processes such as presenting numbers, dates, or times; sorting lists linguistically; providing defaults for items such as the presentation of a calendar, or common units of measurement; selecting between 12- vs. 24-hour time presentation; and many other details that users might find too tedious to set individually. Collectively, these preferences are usually called a <a>locale</a>. The extensions to [[BCP47]] that define <a>Unicode locales</a> [[CLDR]] provide the basis for <a>internationalization</a> APIs on the Web, notably the JavaScript language [[ECMASCRIPT]] uses <a>Unicode locales</a> as the basis for the APIs found in [[ECMA-402]].</p>
      
        <p>Document formats and protocols often need to provide metadata about the <a>natural language</a> of content or perform <a></a>language negotiation</a> when selecting appropriate content on the Web. For more information and best practices related to the specification and use of language tags as metadata, see [[STRING-META]].</p>

        <h3>What are Internationalization and Localization?</h3>
        <p>Users who speak different languages or come from different cultural
          backgrounds usually require software and services that are adapted to
          correctly process information using their native languages, writing
          systems, measurement systems, calendars, and other linguistic rules
          and cultural conventions.</p>
        <p><dfn id="international-preferences">International Preferences</dfn> A
          user's particular set of cultural conventions, language, and
          formatting choices that software must employ to correctly process or
          present information exchanged with that user.</p>
          
        <p><dfn id="internationalization" data-lt="internationalization|I18N|internationalized">Internationalization</dfn> The design and development of a product that is enabled for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language. Internationalization is sometimes abbreviated <code>I18N</code> because there are eighteen letters between the "i" and the "n" in the English word.</p>
        
        <p>There are many kinds of international preferences that may be offered
          on the Web in order for the content or service to be considered usable
          and acceptable by users around the world. Some of these preferences
          might include:
        <ul>
          <li>Natural language for text processing: parsing, spell checking, and
            grammar checking are examples of this;</li>
          <li>User interface language, which may include items like images,
            colors, sounds, formats, and navigational elements as well as the
            visible strings;</li>
          <li>Presentation (human-oriented formatting) of dates, times, numbers,
            lists, and other values;</li>
          <li>Collation, sorting, and organization of content (such as in a
            phone book or a dictionary);</li>
          <li>Alternate time-keeping and calendars, which may include holidays,
            work rules, weekday/weekend distinctions, the number and
            organization of months, the numbering of years, and so forth;</li>
          <li>Tax or regulatory regime;</li>
          <li>Currency</li>
        </ul>
        ... and many more. </p>
        
        <p>Because there are a large number of preferences, software systems (operating environments and programming languages) often use an identifier that combines natural language and other information, such as region or country, as a shorthand indicator for collections of preferences that typify categories of users that share certain cultural preferences.</p>
          
        <p>HTML for example uses the <code>lang</code> attribute to indicate the language of segments of content. XML uses the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute for the same purpose.</p>
        
        <p><dfn data-lt="localization|localized|L10N">Localization</dfn> The tailoring of a system to the individual cultural expectations of a specific target market or group of individuals. Localization includes, but is not limited to, the translation of user-facing text and messages. Localization is sometimes abbreviated as <code>L10N</code> because there are ten letters between the "L" and the "N" in the English word. When a particular set of content and preferences corresponding to a specific set of international preferences is operationally available, then the system is said to be <em>localized</em>.</p>
          
        <p><dfn id="locale">Locale</dfn> A collection of international preferences, generally related to a language and geographic region, that is passed in APIs or set in the operating environment to get culturally affected behavior from a system or process. Usually a locale is identified by an id or shorthand token, such as a language tag.</p>
        
        <p>Generally, systems that are internationalized can support a wide range of locales (collections of languages and locally-tailored behaviors and defaults) in order to meet the international preferences of many kinds of users. When a particular system can respond to changes in the locale by trying to load different resources or by performing culturally appropriate formatting, we say that this system is <dfn data-lt="locale aware|locale-aware|enabled|enable">locale-aware</dfn> or <em>enabled</em>.</p>
        
        <p><a>Language tags</a> can provide information about the language, script, region, and various specially-registered variants using subtags. But sometimes there are international preferences that do not correlate directly with any of these. For example, many cultures have more than one way of sorting content items, and so the appropriate sort ordering cannot always be inferred from the language tag by itself. Thus a German language user might want to choose between the sort ordering used in a dictionary versus that used in a phone book.</p>
        
        <p>Historically, locales were identified by the programming language or operating environment of the user. This application-specific identifier was often inferred from language tags. For example, an implementation could map a language tag from an existing protocol, such as HTTP's Accept-Language header, to its locale model.</p>
        
        <p><dfn data-lt="common locale data repository|CLDR">Common Locale Data Repository</dfn> or <em>CLDR</em> [[CLDR]] is a Unicode Consortium project that defines, collects, and curates sets of <a>locale</a> data needed to <a>enable</a> systems or operating environments. CLDR data and its locale model are widely adopted, particularly in browsers.</p>
        
        <p><dfn>Unicode Locale</dfn>. A combination of language tag extensions ([[RFC6067]], [[RFC6497]]) and additional processing rules defined by [[CLDR]] to support <a>locales</a>. A Unicode locale provides the ability to specify in a language tag international preference variations that go beyond linguistic or regional variation or to select formatting behavior or content when there are multiple options.  Unicode locale identifiers are identical to language tags, but apply additional rules about the content of certain language tags. Unicode Locales increasingly form the basis for <a>internationalization</a> on the Web, particularly as part of the <code>Intl</code> locale framework [[ECMA-402]] in JavaScript [[ECMASCRIPT]].</p>
        
        <p>Unicode's [[CLDR]] project maintains both [[BCP47]] extensions related to Unicode locales. The Unicode locale language tag extension [[RFC6067]] uses the <code>-u-</code> subtag, and provides subtags for selecting different locale-based formats and behaviors.</p>
        
        <aside class="example">
			<p>Here are a few selected examples of Unicode locale variations.</p>
			<p>In the first example, the value <code>123456789.5678</code> is formatted using the locale rules represented by the various language tags. Notice how the <code>u</code> extension and its <code>nu</code> keyword are used to select  between Latin and Devanagari digit shapes in the Hindi-as-used-in-India (<code>hi-IN</code>) locale and between Latin and Arabic script digit shaps in the Arabic (<code>ar</code>) locale.</p>

             <p>In the second example, the date value corresponding to 11 July 2020 on the Gregorian calendar is formatted using various different locales.

Other examples show the Japanese Imperial calendar and one type of Islamic calendar. Notice in the last example that the calendar is not restricted to a specific locale: here we show the Islamic calendar system in an English locale.</p>

        <p>The Transformed Content extension [[RFC6497]], which uses the <code>-t-</code> subtag, provides subtags for text transformations, such as transliteration between scripts.</p>
        
        <p>It is important to remember that every <a>Unicode locale</a> identifier is <em>also</em> a <a>well-formed</a> [[BCP47]] language tag.</p>

        <p><dfn>Language negotiation</dfn> is the process of matching a user's <a>international preferences</a> to available localized resources, content, or processing. The user's preferences are usually expressed as a <a>locale</a> or prioritized list of locales.

In many cases the language negotiation algorithm uses <dfn data-lt="locale fallback|fallback">locale fallback</dfn> that proceeds from more-specific resources to more-general ones following a deterministic pattern.</p>

        <h3>Languages, Language Tags and Matching of Language Tags</h3>
        
        <p>This document uses the term <dfn>language</dfn> to
          refer to what is sometimes called a <em><dfn>natural language</dfn></em>: the
          spoken, written, or signed communications used by human beings.</p>
        <p>There are many ways that languages might be identified and many
          reasons that software might need to identify the language of content
          on the Web. Document formats and protocols on the Web generally use
          the identifiers used in most other parts of the Internet, consisting
          of the language tags defined in [[BCP47]].</p>
        <p>[[BCP47]] is a multipart document consisting, at the time this
          document was published, of two separate RFCs. The first part, called <em>Tags
            for Identifying Languages</em> [[RFC5646]], defines the grammar,
          form, and terminology of language tags. The second part, called <em>Matching
            of Language Tags</em> [[RFC4647]], describes several schemes for
          matching, comparing, and selecting content using language tags and
          includes useful terminology related to comparison of language
          preferences to tagged content.</p>
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="language tag|language tags">language tag</dfn> is a string used as an identifier for a language. In this document, the term <em>language tag</em> always refers explicitly to a [[BCP47]] language tag. These language tags consist of one or more subtags.</p>
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="subtag|subtags">subtag</dfn> is a sequence of ASCII letters or
          digits separated from other subtags by the hyphen-minus character and
          identifying a specific element of meaning withing the overall language
          tag. In [[BCP47]], subtags can consist of upper or lowercase ASCII
          letters (the case carries no distinction) or ASCII digits. Subtags are
          limited to no more than eight characters (although additional length
          restrictions apply depending on the specific use of the subtag).</p>
        <p>Selecting content or behavior based on the language tag requires a
          few additional concepts defined by [[RFC4647]]. In this document, we
          adopt the following terminology:</p>
          
        <p>The <dfn data-lt="iana language subtag registry|subtag registry|registry|lstr">IANA Language Subtag Registry</dfn> is a machine-readable text file available via IANA which contains a comprehensive list of all of the subtags valid in language tags. (Link: <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry">Registry</a>)</p>
          
        <p>[[BCP47]] defines two different levels of conformance. See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-2.2.9">classes of conformance</a> in [[BCP47]] for specifics. For language tags, the levels of conformance correspond to type of checking that an implementation applies to language tag values.</p>
        
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="well-formed|well-formed language tag">well-formed language tag</dfn> follows the grammar defined in [[BCP47]]. That is, it is structurally correct, consisting of ASCII letters and digit <a>subtags</a> of the prescribed length, separated by hyphens.</p>
        
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="valid|valid language tag">valid language tag</dfn> has been checked to ensure that each of the subtags appears in the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry">Language Subtag Registry</a> hosted by IANA.</p>
        
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="canonical Unicode locale identifier|canonical tag|canonical locale">canonical Unicode locale identifier</dfn> is a <a>well-formed</a> language tag that also conforms to the additional rules for <em>Unicode locale identifiers</em> found in [[CLDR]] (see <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_locale_identifier">Section 3</a>). <a>Unicode locales</a> define additional conformance criteria and normalization steps beyond that found in [[BCP47]] that help make language tags more consistent and interoperable.</p>
          
        <p>A <dfn title="language-range">language range</dfn> is a string
          similar in structure to a language tag that is used for "identifying
          sets of language tags that share specific attributes".</p>
        <p>A <dfn>language priority list</dfn> is a collection of one or more language ranges identifying the user's language preferences for use in matching. As the name suggests, such lists are normally ordered or weighted according to the user's preferences. The HTTP [[RFC2616]] <code>Accept-Language</code> [[RFC3282]] header is an example of one kind of language  priority list.</p>
        <p>A <dfn title="basic-language-range">basic language range</dfn> is
          simply a language tag used to express a language preference. An <dfn

            title="extended-language-range">extended language range</dfn> allows
          a more expressive set of language preference through the use of a
          wildcard subtag <q><code>*</code></q>.</p>
        <aside class="example">
          <p>Basic versus extended language range and language priority list</p>
          <p>The string <code>de-de</code> is a basic language range. It
            matches, for example, the language tag <code>de-DE-1996</code>, but
            not the language tag <code>de-Deva</code>.</p>
          <p>The string <code>de-*-DE</code> is an extended language range. It
            matches all of the following tags:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><code>de-DE</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><code>de-DE-x-goethe</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><code>de-Latn-DE-1996</code></p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><code>"en; fr; zh-Hant"</code> is a language priority list. It would be read as "<span class="quote">English before French before Chinese as written in the Traditional script</span>". Note that the syntax shown is only an example, since it depends on the protocol, application, or implementation that uses the list.</p>
        </aside>
                  
        <p>Some <a>language priority lists</a>, such as the <code>Accept-Language</code> [[RFC3282]] header mentioned earlier, provide "weights" for values appearing in the list. Such weighting cannot be depended on for anything other than ordering the list.</p>

        <p>The "BCP" nomenclature refers to the current set of RFCs that form the "best current practice". At the time this document was published, [[BCP47]] consisted of two RFCs: <cite>Tags for the Identification of Languages </cite>[[RFC5646]] and <cite>Matching of Language Tags</cite> [[RFC4647]].</p>
        
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-successor-ref"><a href="#ltli-successor-ref" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Formulations such as "<span class="quote">RFC 5646 or its successor</span>" MAY be used, but only in cases where the specific document version is necessary.</p>
        <p>While this style of reference was once popular, using the
          BCP reference is more accurate. Since the grammar of language tags has
          been fixed since [[RFC4646]], referring to the BCP will not incur
          additional compliance risk to most implementations.</p>
          
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-no-obsolete-refs"><a href="#ltli-no-obsolete-refs" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Specifications MUST NOT reference obsolete versions of [[BCP47]], such as [[RFC1766]] or [[RFC3066]].</p>
        
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-obs-language-tag-ref"><a href="#ltli-obs-language-tag-ref" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Specifications that need to preserve compatibility with obsolete versions of [[BCP47]] MUST reference the production <code>obs-language-tag</code> in [[BCP47]].</p>
        
        <p>Beginning with [[RFC4646]], [[BCP47]] defined a more complex, machine-readable syntax for language tags. Some specifications might desire or require compatibility with the older language tag grammar found in previous versions of BCP47 (specifically [[RFC1766]] and [[RFC3066]]). This grammar was more permissive and is described in [[BCP47]] as the ABNF production <code>obs-language-tag</code>. [[RFC4646]], which introduced the current grammar for language tags, is itself obsolete.</p>
        
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-bcp47-extension-ref"><a href="#ltli-bcp47-extension-ref" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Specifications MAY reference registered extensions to [[BCP47]] as necessary.</p>
        <p>In particular, [[RFC6067]] defines the <cite>BCP 47 Extension U</cite>, also known as "Unicode Locales". This extension to [[BCP47]] provides additional subtag sequences for selecting specific locale variations.</p>
        
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-well-formed-req"><a href="#ltli-well-formed-req" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Specifications SHOULD require that language tags be <a>well-formed</a>.</p>
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-valid-req"><a href="#ltli-valid-req" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Specifications MAY require that language tags be <a>valid</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Checking if a tag is <a>valid</a> requires access to or a copy of the registry plus additional runtime logic. While content authors are advised to choose, generate, and exchange only valid values, language tag matching and other common language tag operations are designed so that validity checking is not needed. Features or functions that need to understand the specific semantic content of subtags are the main reason that a specification would normatively require <a>valid</a> tags as part of the protocol or document format.</p>
        
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-canonical-author-req"><a class="self" href="#ltli-canonical-author-req">&#x200B;</a>Content authors SHOULD choose language tags that are <a>canonical Unicode locale identifiers</a>.</p>
        
        <p>The additional content restrictions and normalization steps found in <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Canonical_Unicode_Locale_Identifiers">Section 3</a> of [[LDML]] provide for better interoperability and consistency than that afforded by [[BCP47]] directly.</p>

        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-canonical-impl-req"><a class="self" href="#ltli-canonical-impl-req">&#x200B;</a>Implementations SHOULD only emit language tags that are <a>canonical Unicode locale identifiers</a> and SHOULD normalize language tags that they consume using the rules for producing canonical tags.</p>
        
        <p>As above, the additional content restrictions and normalization steps found in <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Canonical_Unicode_Locale_Identifiers">Section 3</a> of [[LDML]] provide for better interoperability and consistency than that afforded by [[BCP47]] directly. This best practice should not be interpreted as meaning that implementations need to support, generate, process, or understand either of [[CLDR]]'s extensions.</p>
        
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-valid-content-req"><a href="#ltli-valid-content-req" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Specifications SHOULD require content authors use <a>valid</a> language tags.</p>
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-validator-req"><a href="#ltli-validator-req" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Content validators SHOULD check if content uses <a>valid</a> language tags where feasible.</p>
        
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-no-subsidiary-stds"><a href="#ltli-no-subsidiary-stds" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Specifications SHOULD NOT reference [[BCP47]]'s underlying standards that contribute to the <a>IANA Language Subtag Registry</a>, such as ISO639, ISO15924, ISO3066, or UN M.49.</p>
        
        <p>Some standards might directly consume one of [[BCP47]]'s contributory standards, in which case a reference is wholly appropriate. However, in most cases, the purpose of the reference is to specify a valid list of codes and their meanings. [[BCP47]]'s <a>subtag registry</a> is stabilized and resolves ambiguity in a number of useful ways and so should be the preferred source for this type of reference.</p>
        
		<p class="advisement" id="ltli-language-information-in-uris-req"><a href="#ltli-language-information-in-uris-req" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Applications that provide language information as part of URIs (e.g. in the realm of RDF) SHOULD use [[BCP47]].</p>
		
		<p>Currently, URIs expressing language information often use values from parts of ISO 639. This leads to situations in which there are ambiguities about what the proper value should be, e.g. for German <code>de</code> from ISO 639-1 or <code>ger</code> from ISO 639-2. By using BCP 47 and its language sub tag registry, such ambiguities can be avoided, e.g. for German, the registry contains only <code>de</code>.</p>
        
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-range-type-req"><a href="#ltli-range-type-req" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Specifications that define language tag matching or <a>language negotiation</a> MUST specify whether language ranges used are a <a>basic language range</a> or an <a>extended language range</a>.</p>
        
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-matching-result-ref"><a href="#ltli-matching-result-ref" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Specifications that define language tag matching MUST specify whether the results of a matching operation contains a single result (<em>lookup</em> as defined in [[RFC4647]]), or a possibly-empty (zero or more) set of results (<em>filtering</em> as defined in [[RFC4647]]).</p>
        
        <p class="advisement" id="ltli-matching-type-ref"><a href="#ltli-matching-type-ref" class="self">&#x200B;</a>Specifications that define language tag matching MUST specify the matching algorithms available and the selection mechanism.</p>
        
        <p>For example, JavaScript internationalization [[ECMA-402]] and [[CLDR]] provide a "best fit" algorithm which can be tailored by implementers.</p>
